# Arbitrage-Model

This is an arbitrage model that tracks, in real-time, rates of XRP across 3 different exhanges, and notifies the user as  
to buy/sell from and to a particular exchange.  
It will also notify the user as to the profit he/she will be making.

### Capabilities so far:

1. Successfully retrieves relevant data from all 3 APIs
2. Data is stored in a "queue" for further computations

### What needs to be implemented:

1. The actual math behind the arbitrage model (which should be fairly simple)
2. The numerical mathematical terms and their manifestation for the aforementioned calculation is not yet clear to me (the creator of the program)

##### After achieving the points to be implemented, further work is pretty simple and can be completed fairly quickly

### How this can be scaled up:
This can be made to be an arbitrage model for not only XRP, but for many other cryptocurrencies with minor modifications to the existing program.
